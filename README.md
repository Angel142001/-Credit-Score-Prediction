# -Credit-Score-Prediction
This project automates credit score classification into "Good," "Standard," or "Poor" using machine learning. We processed a financial dataset with 28 features, addressing missing values, outliers, and invalid entries. Built and tuned models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a final Stacking Classifier. The best model achieved 77.19% test accuracy, helping automate credit risk assessments and improve decision-making for financial institutions.
